I'm beginning to have trouble thinking up new ways to title these posts. While I navigate my clumsy way through learning how to 
set up and use this site, I realize that I've written what amounts to a *"First Post"* about six or seven times now. I think I better 
just start calling them something like *Test Post*, or *Trial Run*. Something generic and easily numbered in case I want to track 
the attempts. At this rate, I'll have effectively killed any sense of accomplishment or hopeful new-beginnings that sometimes accompany 
the start of a new project.

This sounds stupid, I know. But this is how my mind works and I learned *long* ago that I can't change it or escape it. So...

### Welcome to Test Post #1...

A 'quick peek' at the final product as it slowly turns into whatever it's going to eventually be. I leave you with these words -- 
*words to live by* -- and then you may see yourself out:

> "Aggression will save you when caution fails."
