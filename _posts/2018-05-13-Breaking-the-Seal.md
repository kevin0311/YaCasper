I'm not sure why (because I have zero prior experience with operating my own blog) but it *seems* like I'm probably supposed to have an 'official *first post* for this thing. I don't imagine there's a **Rules for Blogs and Blogging** manual that would back that up, so I have nothing more substantial than the feeling that it's necessary. Is it just my subconcious prodding me to do it, based on a vague reasoning shaped by societal norms and too much TV? Maybe it just boils down to an attempt at *good manners* -- you know, kind of like introducing yourself the first time you show up in a new place, surrounded by new people. Or maybe our brains need things like this to act as a reference, or marker, for something new in our lives that we at least *want* to have some measure of signifigance. Psychologically, starting something new could easily act as a source of unexplored potential and possibility in ones life. So doing something to make that 'new beginning' feel as real or tangible as possible would seem to be a logical thing to do. Once done, we can look to it and say:

> "Here is a beginning...a start of something new. Where before there was nothing, *now* there is something new that is a part of who I am and could possibly take my life in a new direction". 

All that being said, I admit I'm bullshitting my way through this (something I do a *lot*) and I'm still no closer to a good reason for this. Odd, because it's not like me to do much of *anything* without a decent reason for expending even a little energy. Stranger still because I don't imagine anyone besides myself will ever see these posts to receive whatever benefit one might derive from reading such things. It's not like it's the "Grand Opening" of some cool new store or the "Series/Season Premiere" for **Into the Badlands** or **Preacher** -- which are both monumentally important shows to me and anyone else having the slightest trace of good taste. So, it's also possible -- probably even *likely* -- that I'm just over-thinking the whole thing and typing out the nonsensical and long winded results (I belive I already made mention of my tendency to engage in the fine art of *bullshitting*).

In the unlikely event of me spending the rest of the night researching this topic on Google and whatever cryptic corners of the internet it leads me to (and eventually actually finding the answer), I suppose I'll never know. As much as that thought pains me, I can live with it...I'll just have to muddle through somehow. And I can console myself somewhat with the knowledge that, unlike the majority of my undertakings which generally end with me having nothing to show for them, this one ends with me having a shiny, new 'Official First Post' for my blog.
